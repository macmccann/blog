    If you haven't seen the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man%3A_Into_the_Spider-Verse">new Spider-Man movie yet</a>, do yourself a favor and bug someone into going to the movie theater with you. It's absolutely worth seeing on the big screen with surround sound, and it's the best film I've seen in a long time.
